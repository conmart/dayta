## Welcome to Dayta

Dayta is a simple, mobile first app to log and track events that happen in your day to day life. For example, I use Dayta to keep track of which of my plants I have watered on which days, when I last replaced my toothbrush, and how good Iâ€™ve been about flossing recently to name a few.
